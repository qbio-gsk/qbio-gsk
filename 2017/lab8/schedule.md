# Schedule of Lab 8

Monday Apr 2, 2017, 3-5pm, with one break for 10-15 min

## Accessing data from public repositories and discuss project ideas.

- Review ways we have already imported data: make your own, download with URL inside R using readr or read.csv, using the ggplot2 example dataset, subset another dataset, use bioconductor to import, ftp.
- Review pre-processing pipeline if using raw fastq files as in the appendix here: https://www.bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2015/CSAMA2015/lab/Epigenetics_and_Chip_seqLab.pdf
- Various forms of publicly available high-throughput data: [ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org/), [cBioPortal](http://www.cbioportal.org/), [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), SRA ENA, etc.
- Examples for accessing uniprot and PDB through R.
- Examples of projects from last class.
